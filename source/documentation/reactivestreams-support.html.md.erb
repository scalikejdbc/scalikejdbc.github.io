title: Reactive Streams Support - ScalikeJDBC

## Reactive Streams Support

<hr/>
Since version 3.0, ScalikeJDBC has introduced support for the [Publisher](https://www.reactive-streams.org/reactive-streams-1.0.4-javadoc/org/reactivestreams/Publisher.html) interface of Reactive Streams. This allows you to subscribe to a stream of results from a database query, enhancing the library's capabilities for handling data flows reactively.

scalikejdbc-streams is a Reactive Streams 1.0 compliant implementation, which passes the `PublisherVerification` tests within the [Reactive Streams TCK](https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/tree/v1.0.0/tck). 

Originally, scalikejdbc-streams is assumed to be particularly suitable for batch applications that require processing large datasets. Note that you need to keep borrowing a connection while someone is still subscribing a stream provided by `scalikejdbc-streams`. Also, be aware of the max size of connection pool and carefully monitor the state of the pool.

### Setup
<hr/>

Add the following aditional dependency to your sbt project.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.scalikejdbc" %% "scalikejdbc-streams" % "<%= version %>"
```

### Usage
<hr/>

#### First Example

```scala
import scalikejdbc._
import scalikejdbc.streams._  // 1. import streams module. This provides SQL#iterator & DB#readOnlyStream.
import java.util.concurrent._

case class Company(id: Long, name: String, countryId: Option[Long], country: Option[Country] = None)

object Company extends SQLSyntaxSupport[Company] {

  // 2. Make a StreamReadySQL object for create publisher.
  //    The StreamReadySQL is immutable, so you can reuse it like SQL object.
  def streamBy(condition: SQLSyntax): StreamReadySQL[Company] = {
    withSQL {
      select.from(Company as m).where(condition)
    }.map(Company(m.resultName)).iterator()
  }
}

// ------------
// Prepare a connection pool in advance.
// https://scalikejdbc.org/documentation/configuration.html#scalikejdbc-config

// Prepare an ExecutionContext
implicit val publisherEC: ExecutionContext = ???

// 3. Get a publisher from DB (or NamedDB) object.
//    You need to give a StreamReadySQL object to readOnlyStream method.
val publisher: DatabasePublisher[Company] = DB readOnlyStream {
  Company.streamBy(sqls"id < 1000")
}

// 4. Give a Reactive Streams Subscriber to it.
publisher.subscribe(subscriber)
```

The `DatabasePublisher` capsulates an `ExecutionContext` to inside.
We also recommend using `ExecutionContext` which is separate from the main thread pool.

The Subscriber example is here:

<hr/>
#### Adjust DBSession attributes

At the current moment, `scalikejdbc-streams` natively supports MySQL and PostgreSQL.
When using `SQL#iterator` factory method normally, ScalikeJDBC automatically enables required settings to use cursor feature.
If you don't prefer the behavior, you can customize adjusting DBSession attributes instead.

```scala
val publisher: DatabasePublisher[Int] = DB readOnlyStream {
  sql"select id from users".map(r => r.int("id"))
    .iterator
    .withDBSessionForceAdjuster(session => {
      session.conn.setAutoCommit(true)
    })
}
```


<hr/>
#### Integrate with Akka Streams

It is easy to integrate `scalikejdbc-streams` with another library that supports Reactive Streams. For example, Akka Streams, you can give a ScalikeJDBC's publisher to Akka Streams Source as follows.

```scala
implicit val system = ActorSystem("streams")
import system.dispatcher
implicit val materializer = ActorMaterializer()

Source.fromPublisher(publisher).filter(_.id % 2 == 0).runForeach(println)
```
