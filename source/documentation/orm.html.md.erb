## ORM

<hr/>
### Rich O/R Mapper
<hr/>

For those who require more robust functionalities, consider using scalikejdbc-orm. This extension is an O/R mapper built on top of the ScalikeJDBC core library, drawing significant inspiration from Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord library.

#### Efficient Data Fetching with Join Queries / Eager Loading

One of the standout features of scalikejdbc-orm is its ability to efficiently handle data associations, effectively eliminating the common N+1 query problem. This is achieved through the smart use of join queries in resolving associations like `#belongsTo`, `#hasOne`, and `#hasMany/#hasManyThrough`. These are processed behind the scenes, allowing you to focus on your application without worrying about performance degradation due to N+1 issues.

While join queries are suitable for many scenarios, some complex data relationships might require a different approach. For such use cases, you can do eager loading (i.e. resolve the main entity and then perform in-clause query to resolve deep nested associations) with the `#includes` method.

<hr/>
### Setup
<hr/>

In addition to the core library, add the library along with a JDBC driver and logging tool:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.scalikejdbc" %% "scalikejdbc-orm" % "<%= version %>",
  "com.h2database"  %  "h2"              % "<%= h2_version %>",
  "ch.qos.logback"  %  "logback-classic" % "<%= logback_version %>"
)
```

<hr/>
### Quick Example
<hr/>

Save the following code as `example.scala`:

```scala
import java.time.ZonedDateTime

import scalikejdbc.*
import scalikejdbc.orm.*
import scalikejdbc.orm.timstamps.TimestampsFeature

case class Email(
  id: Long,
  memberId: Long,
  address: String,
)
object Email extends CRUDMapper[Email] {
  override lazy val tableName = "member_email"
  lazy val defaultAlias = createAlias("me")
  def extract(rs: WrappedResultSet, e: ResultName[Email]): Email = autoConstruct(rs, e)
}

case class Member(
  id: Long,
  name: Option[String],
  createdAt: ZonedDateTime,
  updatedAt: Option[ZonedDateTime],
  email: Option[Email] = None,
)
object Member extends CRUDMapper[Member] with TimestampsFeature[Member] {
  lazy val defaultAlias = createAlias("m")
  def extract(rs: WrappedResultSet, n: ResultName[Member]): Member = autoConstruct(rs, n, "email")

  val email = hasOne[Email](Email, (m, e) => m.copy(email = e))
}

object Example extends App {
  // ### Database connection ###
  Class.forName("org.h2.Driver")
  ConnectionPool.singleton("jdbc:h2:mem:hello;MODE=PostgreSQL", "user", "pass")
  implicit val session: DBSession = AutoSession

  // ### Create tables ###
  sql"""create table member (
    id serial not null primary key,
    name varchar(64),
    created_at timestamp not null,
    updated_at timestamp
  )""".execute.apply()
  sql"""create table member_email (
    id serial not null primary key,
    member_id int not null,
    address varchar(256) not null
  )""".execute.apply()

  val m = Member.column

  // ### Insert rows ###
  val ids = Seq("Alice", "Bob", "Chris") map { name =>
    // insert into member (name, created_at, updated_at) values ('Alice', '2024-05-11 14:52:27.13', '2024-05-11 14:52:27.13');
    Member.createWithNamedValues(m.name -> name)
  }

  // ### Find all rows ###
  // select m.id as i_on_m, m.name as n_on_m, m.created_at as ca_on_m, m.updated_at as ua_on_m from member m order by m.id;
  val allMembers1: Seq[Member] = Member.findAll()
  // select m.id as i_on_m, m.name as n_on_m, m.created_at as ca_on_m, m.updated_at as ua_on_m from member m where m.id in (1, 2, 3);
  val allMembers2: Seq[Member] = Member.findAllByIds(ids*)

  // ### Run queries with where conditions ###
  // Quick way but less type-safety
  // select m.id as i_on_m, m.name as n_on_m, m.created_at as ca_on_m, m.updated_at as ua_on_m from member m where m.name = 'Alice' order by m.id;
  val member1: Seq[Member] = Member.where("name" -> "Alice").apply()
  // Types-safe query builder
  // select m.id as i_on_m, m.name as n_on_m, m.created_at as ca_on_m, m.updated_at as ua_on_m from member m where name = 'Alice' order by m.id;
  val member2: Seq[Member] = Member.where(sqls.eq(m.name, "Alice")).apply()

  val memberId = member2.head.id

  // ### Run join queries ###
  val e = Email.column
  // insert into member_email (member_id, address) values (1, 'a@example.com');
  Email.createWithNamedValues(e.memberId -> memberId, e.address -> "a@example.com")

  // Note that member3.email exists while it does not in member1,2
  // select m.id as i_on_m, m.name as n_on_m, m.created_at as ca_on_m, m.updated_at as ua_on_m , me.id as i_on_me, me.member_id as mi_on_me, me.address as a_on_me from member m left join member_email me on m.id = me.member_id where name = 'Alice' order by m.id;
  val member3 = Member.joins(Member.email).where(sqls.eq(m.name, "Alice")).apply()

  // ### Update/delete rows ###
  // update member set updated_at = '2024-05-11 14:52:27.188', name = 'Ace' where id = 1;
  Member.updateById(memberId).withAttributes("name" -> "Ace")
  // delete from member where id = 1;
  Member.deleteById(memberId)
}
```

Run the code by the `sbt run` command. How did it go?

### Associations
<hr/>

The key feature of ORM is definitely how it resolves associations for developers. ScalikeJDBC ORM does it in a quite similar way to ActiveRecord from Ruby on Rails. In this section, we will guide you on how to define assocations in code.

In the realm of O/R mapper, the hallmark feature lies in its ability to effortlessly resolve associations for developers. ScalikeJDBC ORM achieves this with a striking resemblance to ActiveRecord from Ruby on Rails. In the following section, we'll walk you through defining associations in your code.

[This test code](https://github.com/scalikejdbc/scalikejdbc/tree/master/scalikejdbc-orm/src/test/scala/basic_test/accounts) provides invaluable insights for learning. If you're unable to find specific examples here, referring to the code will be greatly helpful.

<hr/>
#### hasOne

The `hasOne` relationship signifies that table A is referenced from table B via table A's primary key. Your code aims to include table B's data within the entity of table A. In the following example, the `Member` entity (representing table A) includes a `name` property, which can be resolved using the `member_id` column within the `Name` entity (representing table B).

```scala
import scalikejdbc.*
import scalikejdbc.orm.*

case class Member(
  id: Long,
  name: Option[Name] = None,
)
object Member extends CRUDMapper[Member] {
  override val tableName = "members"
  override val defaultAlias = createAlias("m")
  override def extract(rs: WrappedResultSet, n: ResultName[Member]): Member = autoConstruct(rs, rn, "name")

  val name: Association[Member] = hasOne[Name](Name, (m, name) => m.copy(name = name))
}

case class Name(
  memberId: Long,
  first: String,
  last: String,
)

object Name extends CRUDMapper[Name] {
  override val useAutoIncrementPrimaryKey = false
  override val tableName = "names"
  override val primaryKeyFieldName = "memberId"
  override val defaultAlias = createAlias("nm")

  def extract(rs: WrappedResultSet, s: ResultName[Name]): Name = autoConstruct(rs, s)
}
```

Your code can run queries this way:

```scala
// Finder method style
val member: Option[Member] = Member.joins(Member.name).findById(123)

// Querying API style
val member: Option[Member] = Member.joins(Member.name).where(sqls.eq(m.id, 123)).apply()
```

If table B has a row with `member_id: 123`, `member.map(_.name)` is present. When you can assume the `name` already exists and would like to resolve the data at any time, add `#byDefault` method call to the `hasOne` call as below. In this case, you'll never need to have the reference to the result. Thus, you can remove `Member.name` property.

```scala
object Member extends CRUDMapper[Member] {
  // ....

  hasOne[Name](Name, (m, name) => m.copy(name = name)).byDefault
}
```

This `#byDefault` method is available for all other association APIs.

<hr/>
#### belongsTo

The `belongsTo` relationship indicates that table B is referenced from table A via table B's primary key. Your code aims to incorporate table B's data into the entity of table A. In the following example, the `Member` entity (representing table A) includes a `company` property, which can be resolved using the `company_id` column within the entity. From another perspective, the `Company` entity (representing table B) does not contain any information about `Member` (table A).

```scala
import scalikejdbc.*
import scalikejdbc.orm.*

case class Member(
  id: Long,
  name: String,
  companyId: Optional[Long],
  company: Option[Company] = None,
)
object Member extends CRUDMapper[Member] {
  override val defaultAlias = createAlias("m")
  override def extract(rs: WrappedResultSet, n: ResultName[Member]): Member = autoConstruct(rs, rn, "company")

  val company = belongsTo[Company](Company, (m, c) => m.copy(company = c))
}

case class Company(
  id: Long,
  name: String,
)
object Company extends CRUDMapper[Company] {
 override val defaultAlias = createAlias("c")
  def extract(rs: WrappedResultSet, s: ResultName[Name]): Name = autoConstruct(rs, s)
}
```

Here is a code snippet demonstrating how to perform join queries:

```scala
val c = Company.column
val abc = Company.createWithNamedValues(c.name, "ABC Company")
val m = Member.column
Member.createWithNamedValues(m.name -> "Kaz", m.companyId -> abc.map(_.id))

val member: Option[Member] =
  Member.joins(Member.company).where(sqls.eq(m.name, "Kaz")).apply()
```

As mentioned above, once you add `byDefault` call to the `belongsTo` code line, you can omit `.joins(Member.company)` in the code.

<hr/>
#### hasMany

The `hasMany` relationship denotes that table A is referenced from table B via table A's primary key. Your code seeks to include multiple rows from table B into the entity of table A. In the following example, the `Company` entity (representing table A) contains a `members` property, which can be resolved using the `company_id` column on the `Member` entity side (representing table B).

```scala
import scalikejdbc.*
import scalikejdbc.orm.*

case class Company(
  id: Long,
  name: String,
  members: Seq[Member] = Nil,
)
object Company extends CRUDMapper[Company] {
  override val defaultAlias = createAlias("c")
  def extract(rs: WrappedResultSet, s: ResultName[Name]): Name = autoConstruct(rs, s, "members")

  val members = hasMany[Member](
    many = Member -> Member.defaultAlias,
    on = (c, ms) => sqls.eq(c.id, ms.companyId),
    merge = (c, ms) => c.copy(members = ms)
  )
}

case class Member(
  id: Long,
  name: String,
  companyId: Optional[Long],
)
object Member extends CRUDMapper[Member] {
  override val defaultAlias = createAlias("m")
  override def extract(rs: WrappedResultSet, n: ResultName[Member]): Member = autoConstruct(rs, rn)
}
```

Here is a code snippet demonstrating how to perform join queries:

```scala
val c = Company.column
val gf = Company.createWithNamedValues(c.name, "Good Flow")
val companyId = gf.get.id
val m = Member.column
Seq("Kaz", "Yu", "Ken") foreach { name => 
  Member.createWithNamedValues(m.name -> name, m.companyId -> companyId)
}

// company.map(_.members) is a list of three entities
val company: Option[Company] =
  Company.joins(Company.members).findById(companyId)
```

If everything goes well, `company.map(_.members)` should be a list of three entitiy objects.

#### hasManyThrough

The `hasManyThrough` relationship operates similarly to `hasMany`, but with a crucial distinction: it involves a join table that manages the relationship between table A and table B.


```scala
import scalikejdbc.*
import scalikejdbc.orm.*

case class Member(
  id: Long,
  name: String,
  skills: Optional[Skill],
)
object Member extends CRUDMapper[Member] {
  override val defaultAlias = createAlias("m")
  override def extract(rs: WrappedResultSet, n: ResultName[Member]): Member = autoConstruct(rs, rn, "skills")

  val skills = hasManyThrough[Skill](
    MemberSkill,
    Skill,
    (member, ss) => member.copy(skills = ss)
  )
}

case class MemberSkill(memberId: Long, skillId: Long)
object MemberSkill extends JoinTable[MemberSkill] {
  override val defaultAlias = createAlias("ms")
}
case class Skill(id: Long, name: String)
object Skill extends CRUDMapper[Skill] {
  override val defaultAlias = createAlias("s")
  override def extract(rs: WrappedResultSet, s: ResultName[Skill]): Skill = autoConstruct(rs, s)
}
```

Here is a code snippet demonstrating how to perform join queries:

```scala
val alice: Option[Member] =
  Member.joins(Member.skills).findById(123)
```

The `alice.map(_.skills)` should be a list of `Skill` entities if some skills are saved in the "member_skill" table.

<hr/>
#### includes (Eager Loading)

When enabling eager loading via the `includes` API, it's necessary to define both the `belongsTo` etc. and `includes` within the same association claim.

```scala
object Member extends SkinnyCRUDMapper[Member] {

  // Unfortunately, in Scala 2.10.x, the combination of Scala macros and type-dynamic may not always behave as expected, particularly when defining "val company". 
  // If you encounter this issue, consider using alternatives such as "val companyOpt", "companyRef", and so on.
  lazy val companyOpt = {
    // Do normal belongsTo def first
    belongsTo[Company](Company, merge = (m, c) => m.copy(company = c))
    // Then attach includes following the claim API call
    .includes[Company](
      merge = (members, companies) => members.map { m =>
        companies.find(c => m.company.exists(_.id == c.id))
          .map(c => m.copy(company = Some(c)))
          .getOrElse(m)
      })
  }
}

// This line of code performs two queries
// 1) simple select query to fetch all the member table rows
// 2) select query with in clause of IDs toward the company table
// And then the ORM binds the 2) results to relevant entity using the merge function
Member.includes(Member.companyOpt).findAll()
```

Here is another example with `hasManyThrough`:

```scala
object Member extends SkinnyCRUDMapper[Member] {
  lazy val skills =
    hasManyThrough[Skill](
      MemberSkill, Skill, (m, skills) => m.copy(skills = skills)
    ).includes[Skill]((ms, skills) => ms.map { m =>
      m.copy(skills = skills.filter(_.memberId.exists(_ == m.id)))
    })
}

Member.includes(Member.skills).findById(123) // with skills
```

Please note that eager loading of more deeply nested entities is not currently supported. 

While it could be feasible with a dynamic programming language like Ruby, achieving the same functionality with a strictly typed language like Scala is quite challenging. At present, we don't have any plans to enhance this feature unless the Scala language provides a revolutionary hack for us to leverage.
